# Gnome Shell Settings

This is inspired from Omakub. To use the _gnome-extensions_ we would use `gest`. To install gest, run the following command.

```bash
sudo apt install -y gnome-shell-extension-manager pipx
pipx install gnome-extensions-cli --system-site-packages
```

Once all the settings is completed, run the `set-gnome-extensions.sh` script.
